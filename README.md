# Resource Presets Mod

This is a simple Fabric mod, that allows you to quickly change enabled/disabled resource packs and shaders on/off status (if Iris is installed).


Commands:
- `/resourcepreset save <preset_name>` - saves currently used resource packs and shader status, under the name of `<preset_name>`
- `/resourcepreset delete <preset_name>` - deletes a preset
